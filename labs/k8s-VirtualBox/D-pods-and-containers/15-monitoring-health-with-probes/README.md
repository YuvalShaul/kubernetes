# 15 - Monitoring container health with probes

In this lab we are going to demonstrate using probes to monitor containers health.

- [Liveness pod](#Liveness-pod)

## Liveness pod

- Look at **liveness-pod.yaml** from this lab.  
It defines a livenessProbe of the type exec.  
The probe tries to cat a file, that is to be deleted after 30 seconds.
- Run the pod:  
**kubectl apply -f liveness-pod.yaml**
- After 30 seconds, the pods will start to fail and restart.  
Use **kubectl describe pods liveness-exec** to see what's going on.
